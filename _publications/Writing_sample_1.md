This writing is a summary of the work that I have done during the summer internship at Columbia University. It mainly contains two parts: The first part is about a through comparision of HIO and GEC algorithms in solving phase retrieval problem. The second part is about the analysis and mathematical proof of the success reconstruction boundary of GEC algorithm under column orthogonal measurement matrix (e.g. partial FFT)
