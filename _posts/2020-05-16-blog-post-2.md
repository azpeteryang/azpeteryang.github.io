Intall tweepy which is a twitter API provided by twitter
```python
pip install tweepy==3.3.0
```
In order to authorize our app to access Twitter on our behalf, we need to use OAuth interface:

```python
import tweepy
from tweepy import OAuthHandler
consumer_key = 'YOUR-CONSUMER-KEY'
consumer_secret = 'YOUR-CONSUMER-SECRET'
access_token = 'YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN'
access_secret = 'YOUR-ACCESS-SECRET'
 
auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_secret)
 
api = tweepy.API(auth)
```
