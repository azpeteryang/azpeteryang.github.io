# SQL (Structral Query Language)
## Basic Concept
Primary Key： The primary key cannot be the same and try not to change  
Foriegn Key： The Foriegn key can connect many tables
## The SQL Language
### Basic Search
Search for every row in the table:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM <The name of the table>
```
```SQL
SELECT 100+200
```
Calculate 100+200=300
### Conditional Search
```SQL
SELECT * From  <The name of the table>  WHERE  <Condition 1>  AND/OR  <Condition 2>
```
### Projection Search
Search for some columns in the table and can substitute their name
```SQL
SELECT id, score points, name FROM <The name of the table>  WHERE <Condition>
```
### Sorting
```SQL
SELECT id, score, name
FROM <The name of the table>
WHERE <Condition>
ORDER BY <the key to be sorted>
```

### Devide the page
```SQL
SELECT id, score, name
FROM <The name of the table>
WHERE <Condition>
Oreder BY <the key to be sorted> DESC   // in descending order
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 0    //Devide into pages with 3 record in each page, offset = 0 + n * 3
```
### Count the Total Number of the record
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <The name of the table>
```

### Query From more tables
```SQL
SELECT * FROM  <The name of table 1>  <The name of table 2>
```
