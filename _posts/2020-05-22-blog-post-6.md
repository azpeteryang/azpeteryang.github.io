# Statistics and Math
## Some Important Regression Model
##### OLS(Ordinary Least Square Models)
It is the traditional Least Square Models


##### WLS(Weighted Least Square Models)
It has an assumption that the nearer data has more impact on the data to be predicted.



##### Regularized Regression




##### Fixed Effect
There are relationships between k and x in y=kx+b



##### Random Effect
There are no relationship between k and x in y=kx+b



##### Time Series
