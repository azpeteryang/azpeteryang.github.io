# Statistics and Math
## Some Important Regression Model
##### OLS(Ordinary Least Square Models)
It is the traditional Least Square Models


##### WLS(Weighted Least Square Models)
It has an assumption that the nearer data has more impact on the data to be predicted.



##### Regularized Regression




##### Fixed Effect
There are relationships between k and x in y=kx+b



##### Random Effect
There are no relationship between k and x in y=kx+b



##### Time Series




## Bayesian Theorem and Bayesian Estimation










## Tha Basic Knowledge about Statistics
##### Confidence Analysise
Let T represents the confidence area, (1-T) is the probability to reject the hypothesis H0, if the guesser trusts the hypothesis H0, then he can make T higher.


##### The Value of P
If p > 1-T, then accept H0


##### The Design of Experiment
Calculate the chi-square, check it out in the chi-square table.




##### Power Analysis



##### Hypothesis Testing








## The Meassures for Choosing Variables and Dimensionality Reduction

##### PCA  
It is a method to reduce the dimension.







##### Regularized Regression









## Sampling Method (The Steps and the Reason)

##### Random Sampling




##### Stratified Sampling
Divide the whole system into different layers, the elements at different layers should be as different as possible, the element in the same layer should be as similar as possible



##### MCMC









## Optimization

















# Machine Learning
## Algorithms for Classifying
##### Desicion Tree / Regression Tree

##### Random Forest


##### Logistic Regression



##### XGBoost


















## Algorithms for Clustering
##### K-means


##### Hierarchical











## Asset Metrics
##### R squared


##### AUC




##### Sensitivity VS Specificity















## Cross Validation




# Programming (The details will be on the next post)
## SQL
## Python Pandas and Numpy
## Data Visualization
## Modularize and Productionize










# Some Others
