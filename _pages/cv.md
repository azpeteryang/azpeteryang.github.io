Education
======
* B.S. in Communication Engineering, UESTC, 2014-2018
* M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2019- Dec 2020  

Internship experience
======
* Objection Detection Using Machine Learning Methods at Zhun Xing Yun Xue Technology                  Jun-Aug 2017
  * Created a graph generator with multiprocessing techniques using OpenCV, generate large-scale datasets of simulated graphs.
  * Used and compared different methods to pre-process the image datasets, observed that converting the image to the frequency domain has a very good effect in improving the accuracy of the detection.
  * Designed a model for object detection using optimized ResNet by Online Hard Example Mining.
  * The optimized model increased 3% accuracy and 3 times faster training speed comparing to the built-in ResNet in PyTorch.
            
* Software Engineer at Gelan Technology                                                                 Jan-Jul 2018   
  Project: Game Services and Core Engine Technology   
  * Using C++ to construct new features with Lumberyard pipeline, allowing users to import files and folders without locally     pasting through directories.          
  * Collaborated with product managers to design and implement the customer scoring system, including UI implementation with Qt5, dialog prompting decision mechanism, and data streaming into backend data warehouse.      
  * Implemented a feature to create a unified UI and backend behavior for file across all windows in our product, as well as an efficient and cross-platform directory visualization method.      
  * Applied the feature that flexibly collects and asynchronously sends customer telemetry data at various parts of the engine, including UI behaviors, hardware specification, and feature usages.      
  * Collaborated with QA members with owned written unit tests throughout the production period, verifying complex and unclear bugs for steps of the bugs’ reproductions and the solution confirmations, improving productivity of bug fixing time.      
  * Work with UX members to replace the old menu layout with the newly designed, implemented menu layout.      



Projects
======

* Research on the Plasmonic Nano Antenna  
  * Conducted Research on Plasmonic Nano Antenna for Wireless Network of Nano sensors   
  * Compared the effect of using Plasmonic Nano Antennas and using classical antenna (assuming the classical atenna has Perfect Electrical Conductor behavior)   
  * Did Simulation of the length of the Nano Antenna with respect to the frequency in Terahertz band    
  * Designed Dynamic Massive MIMO to solve the distance problem of communicating using Terahertz band by properly placing antenna elements which can swich among different modes.
  
                        
* Psychological Regulation System      
  * Completed a decision tree in analysis process, achieved automatic selection of different videos according to users’ respective psychological conditions.   
  * Used Arduino to develop a method to send data collected from brainwave and skin conductor sensors.   
  * Realized ability to store and retrieve data in self-built Alibaba Cloud database, presented users’ physiological data via curve graph in real time.      


                     
* The Achievement of Water Level Prediction Based on Machine Learning Algorithms 
  * Used Pearson correlation coefficient to design adaptive algorithms, reduce the weight of the data that is less relevant to the current prediction and reduce model complexity.
  * Optimized and Approved the machine learning models (Multivariate Linear Model, Ridge Regression Model, SVM) based on scikit-learn to predict the water level. 
  * Arrived to the result that the optimized Multivariate Linear Model is the best model for the data and reached a very low error rate of 0.022%.
  * Did the data visualization of the water level data prediction. 
  

                
* Grouping Web Application for Hospital
  * Designed a web application to normalize analyte names semi-automatically for Hospital using React.js, MobX, and Bootstra  
  * Built a relational database and handled queries through Object Relational Models with SQLAlchemy and Python.
  * Created REST APIs to handle database requests and conducted unit test with Python Unit-test framework.  
  * Achieved 30% data preparation time reducton for future data science projects by generating accurate analyte groupings.

                           
* Positioning Software Based on Low Energy Bluetooth
  * Built up a software with Java which can show the position of an object, using RSSI propagation model to calculate the distance between the object and the anchor.
  * Applied Kalman filter on RSSI to improve the algorithm, ignored some measuring of RSSI which are larger than a threshold to let the closest anchors measure the distance.
  * Used MATLAB to simulate the results of the new algorithm, reached high accuracy of positioning.
  
                   
* Analysis STBC-MIMO System Under Rayleigh Channel
  * Conduct research on STBC-MIMO system and Space-time block code, used Simulink to build the system model and did preliminary simulation of the system.
  * Analyzed the bit error rate performance curve of the transmitting antenna under the independent Rayleigh channel, compare with the curve of the single transmitting-receiving antenna under the same conditions.
  * Simulated using two transmitted antennas to transmit in order to get the spatial diversity gain, used one receiving antenna to receive signals.
  * Arrived the result that the bit error rate has been significantly decreased after using space-time block codes.
