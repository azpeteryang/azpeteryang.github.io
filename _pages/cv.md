Education
======
* B.S. in Communication Engineering, UESTC, 2014-2018
* M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2019- Dec 2020  

Internship experience
======
* Hand-Written Detection Using Machine Learning Methods at Zhun Xing Yun Xue Technology             
  Jun-Aug 2017
  * Used and compared different methods to pre-process the image datasets, observed that converting the image to the frequency domain has a very good effect in improving the accuracy of hand-written detection.
  * Designed a model for object detection using optimized ResNet by Online Hard Example Mining.
  * The optimized model increased 3% accuracy and 3 times faster training speed comparing to the built-in ResNet in PyTorch.
            
            
* Software Engineer at Gelan Technology                                                                
   Jan-Jul 2018   
  Project: Positioning Software Based on Low Energy Bluetooth   
  * Built up a software with Java which can show the position of an object, using RSSI propagation model to calculate the distance between the object and the anchor.
  * Applied Kalman filter on RSSI to improve the algorithm, ignored some measuring of RSSI which are larger than a threshold to let the closest anchors measure the distance.
  * Used MATLAB to simulate the results of the new algorithm, reached high accuracy of positioning.

* Course Assignments in ECE 6337: Electricity Market                        
  * Calculated the Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow(SCOPF) of the system.
  * Determined power flow of the system, calculated the PTDFs in a power system, using PowerWorld Simulator, diagram to reproduce the system.     
  * Formulated a linear programming problem for the power system and determine the optimal reserve schedule to meet the energy and reserve requirements.      
  

  
 

* The Achievement of Water Level Prediction Based on Machine Learning Algorithms 
  * Used Pearson correlation coefficient to design adaptive algorithms, reduce the weight of the data that is less relevant to the current prediction and reduce model complexity.
  * Optimized and Approved the machine learning models (Multivariate Linear Model, Ridge Regression Model, SVM) based on scikit-learn to predict the water level. 
  * Arrived to the result that the optimized Multivariate Linear Model is the best model for the data and reached a very low error rate of 0.022%.
  * Did the data visualization of the water level data prediction.            
      
  
     
     
* Analysis STBC-MIMO System Under Rayleigh Channel
  * Conduct research on STBC-MIMO system and Space-time block code, used Simulink to build the system model and did preliminary simulation of the system.
  * Analyzed the bit error rate performance curve of the transmitting antenna under the independent Rayleigh channel, compare with the curve of the single transmitting-receiving antenna under the same conditions.
  * Simulated using two transmitted antennas to transmit in order to get the spatial diversity gain, used one receiving antenna to receive signals.
  * Arrived the result that the bit error rate has been significantly decreased after using space-time block codes.
