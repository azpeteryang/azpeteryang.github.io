Hi! Thanks for checking my page! 

I'm Ziqi Zhang(张子琪). Many friends find it hard to pronounce my name correctly, then you can also call me Peter:P 

I'm a Ph.D. student in [the School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology](https://cse.gatech.edu). Before that, I was an undergraduate student in Beidou Honor Class, the department of Electronic and Information Engineering, [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn). 

I'm advised by [Prof. Xiuwei Zhang](https://xiuweizhang.wordpress.com), and I'm generally interested in developing computational methods using single-cell level omics data that help to study the mechanism in cells.

I also did some work in the field of statistical signal processing. I was a visiting student at Columbia University in 2019, where I worked with [Dr. Junjie Ma](http://www.junjiema2.com) on phase retrieval problem. Please check my [Curriculum Vitae](http://PeterZZQ.github.io/files/CV-Ziqi.pdf) for details.

**And check out my another family in the U.S.~**
